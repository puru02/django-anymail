Anymail feature support
-----------------------

The table below summarizes the Anymail features supported for each ESP.
(Scroll it to the left and right to see all ESPs.)

.. currentmodule:: anymail.message

.. It's much easier to edit esp-feature-matrix.csv with a CSV-aware editor, such as:
..   PyCharm (Pro has native CSV support; use a CSV editor plugin with Community)
..   VSCode with a CSV editor extension
..   Excel (watch out for charset issues), Apple Numbers, or Google Sheets
.. Every row must have the same number of columns. If you add a column, you must
.. also add a comma to each sub-heading row. (A CSV editor should handle this for you.)
.. Please keep columns sorted alphabetically by ESP name.

.. csv-table::
    :file: esp-feature-matrix.csv
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: auto
    :class: sticky-left

.. [#caveats]
    Some restrictions apply---see the ESP detail page
    (usually under "Limitations and Quirks").

.. [#nocontrol]
    The ESP supports tracking, but Anymail can't enable/disable it
    for individual messages. See the ESP detail page for more information.

Trying to choose an ESP? Please **don't** start with this table. It's far more
important to consider things like an ESP's deliverability stats, latency, uptime,
and support for developers. The *number* of extra features an ESP offers is almost
meaningless. (And even specific features don't matter if you don't plan to use them.)


Other ESPs

Don't see your favorite ESP here? Anymail is designed to be extensible.
You can suggest that Anymail add an ESP, or even contribute
your own implementation to Anymail. See :ref:`contributing`.
