Anymail is supported and maintained by the people who use it—like you!
We welcome all contributions: issue reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements,
new features, ideas and suggestions, and anything else to help improve the package.

Before posting **questions** or **issues** in GitHub, please check out
[_Getting support_][support] and [_Troubleshooting_][troubleshooting]
in the Anymail docs. Also…

> …when you're reporting a problem or bug, it's _really helpful_ to include:
>
> - which **ESP** you're using (Mailgun, SendGrid, etc.)
> - what **versions** of Anymail, Django, and Python you're running
> - any error messages and exception stack traces
> - the relevant portions of your code and settings
> - any [troubleshooting] you've tried

For more info on **pull requests** and the **development** environment,
please see [_Contributing_][contributing] in the docs. For significant
new features or breaking changes, it's always a good idea to
propose the idea in the [discussions] forum before writing
a lot of code.
