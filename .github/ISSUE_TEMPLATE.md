Reporting an error? It's helpful to know:

- Anymail version
- ESP (Mailgun, SendGrid, etc.)
- Your ANYMAIL settings (change secrets to "redacted")
- Versions of Django, requests, python
- Exact error message and/or stack trace
- Any other relevant code and settings (e.g., for problems
  sending, your code that sends the message)
